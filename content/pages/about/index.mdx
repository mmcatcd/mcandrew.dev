My name is Michael and I'm a final year __Computer Science__ student studying in Trinity College Dublin.
My interests and experience are in distributed systems, internet applications, robotics, next generation
networks and computer vision.

This website is a home for my current and past projects.

Previously I've interned at Salesforce, Trinity College Dublin working on the new app and API for students
and staff, Trinity Live and Educated Machine.

I'm about to start interning with [Inscribe AI](https://inscribe.ai) in 2020 on the detectors team,
building new ways to detect fraudulent documents.
